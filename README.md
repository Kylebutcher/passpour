# Group Project: PassPour

## Overview Description:
Your PassPour Awaits! 
Sip, Track, Explore: PassPour Your Whiskey Journey!

We have created a web application that is your personal assistant tracker for your Whiskey Collection and a Collection of the User's thoughts on each one. We wanted to provide an easy and streight-forward way in keeping track of all of the complex natures that the world's crafters can brew into a single bottle. 

PassPour can help you record your collection of bottles all in one place. Keeping your personal entries of your personal experiences with your bottle unique to you.

You can connect with people and share your recipies and opions on what makes the best whiskey - the best!

With a centralized location accessable anywhere on the web with an account - is your Bucket List there to keep track just about any lead you come accross. From overhearing a friendly local talking about a beautiful bottle to an article in the Whiskey Avocate Magazine, we want to store each lead you find that could bring you to on an adventure to find the most exquisit taste.

Please take a look at our prototype at the bottom of this README and all feedback is welcome!
